🌟 ML Preprocessing Overview
🔄 Preprocessing: Preparing raw data into a clean, usable format before feeding it into an ML model.

⚙️ Key Steps:

Handling missing data (e.g., fill or drop rows/columns).

Encoding categorical variables (e.g., one-hot or label encoding).

Scaling features (e.g., standardization or normalization).

Splitting data into training and testing sets.

📚 Common Libraries for Preprocessing
numpy 🧮: For numerical operations and array manipulations.

pandas 🐼: For data loading, cleaning, and wrangling.

scikit-learn 🤖: Provides tools for preprocessing (e.g., scaling, encoding, splitting data).

matplotlib & seaborn 📊: For data visualization and exploratory data analysis.

🧩 Feature Variables (X)
Represents independent variables or inputs used to predict the target.

Example: 🌼 In the Iris dataset, features could be Sepal Length, Sepal Width, etc.

🎯 Dependent Variable (y)
The output or target variable the model aims to predict.

Example: 🌼 In the Iris dataset, Species (e.g., Iris-setosa, Iris-versicolor) is the dependent variable.
